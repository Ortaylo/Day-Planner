# Day Planner
 This is a basic scheduler for buisness hours, it keeps track of the current time and allows you to to enter tasks and save them to your local storage

 this helped me better understand moment.js as well as Nodes and paths. This exercise forced me to rethink my descisions several times and gave me experience with localstorage and how to use functions.
